              EXPLANATION OF THE CODE
  the program finds the even numbers from 1000 to 3000
the variables are first initialised
then secondly the for loop is brought into play. since we are to to find	the even numbers from 1000 to 3000 we set i to 1000 with limits being <=3000.
    the IF conditions then verifies if the number is positive . And finally the numbers are printed
